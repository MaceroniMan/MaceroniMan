# Emoji Commits

This is a standard definition for commits and releases that start with an emoji for Git and Github.

## Format

The format of Emoji commits and releases shall be **one** Emoji at the start of the commit or release, then a short descripter string after. The descripter shall be anything as long as it describes the commit or release.

The Emoji that starts the commit or release shall represent all of the changes of that commit, however if no such Emoji exists (as per defined below) then feel free to pick a new one as use that Emoji.

Please note that these rules are nothing more than a feeble attempt at standardizing **MY** commits and releases, by no means is this a compleated or extensive definition.
